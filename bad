we If you type “PIR” into a browser, there’s plenty of guidance on how to run one. However there’s not much on addressing the preconceptions people have of the review. When a project has gone very well, stakeholders may think the session is not worth having because there’s nothing to talk about. Nothing went wrong so why spend valuable time discussing it? Conversely, it’s tough bringing stakeholders together when the project hasn’t gone so well and there are still unresolved issues in play. If the project has gone badly, people may jump to the conclusion that the session will result in a brawl and avoid it altogether.

So how do you navigate this situation? How do you ensure you get the right people to the table? And by right people, I mean the ones who are going to help everyone learn the lessons and do things better next time round. My approach is to treat it with honesty and openness. I make sure my agenda reiterates the reason for the review, which clearly lets all participants know that the session is about learning and improving, not finger-pointing. Aside from that, here are my tips to ensuring the session is useful:

Unless it relates to a bedding in period of a new product, strike while the iron’s hot and run a session as close to the end of the project as you can – we’re all busy and moving onto the next thing, often before the last thing is even finished, so don’t wait to schedule the session. It guarantees the details are still fresh in everyone’s mind and the session will be more valuable
